Wanted: Lieutenant Fangore,Blackrock Bounty and Howling in the Hills are pretty hard quests solo. I usually skip them and grind 6.650XP instead. You can try them solo or find a group, if not grind the mentioned XP.

Do: Wanted: Lieutenant Fangore |q 180
step
There is a Drop-Quest-Item Glowing Shadowhide Pendant. You have to turn it in in Elwynn Forest, wich I think is a waste of time for 1.400xp. I will NOT include it in this guide, do it if you want though.
step
The next area is pretty dangerous even for good players. Additionally you might wanna do the escort quest that is in the cave(follow the left side). I usually dont do it,so this guide skips it.

Yowler is pretty hard too, as he has 2-3 adds. Do it if you can, grind 2000xp if you dont
