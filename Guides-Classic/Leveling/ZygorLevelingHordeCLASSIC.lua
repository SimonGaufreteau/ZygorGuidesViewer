|tip This will mean slower leveling but it will be more fun and potentially give you gear upgrades.

|tip We will also say when it is a good time to do the dungeon.
_Note_
|tip This feature is currently experimental and may result in a full quest log. If this happens, please submit a feedback report so we can fix it!
